# Why third party needed ?
if you dont want to use a third party like 'pushsafer' , you need to do the following setups extra and they are much more work than the price of the notification calls at pushsafer , just to mention....\
> you need to write your own Android app which will handle/create the notifications on your device and also handle communication to a fix IP server or domain name. 
> That server need some code to establish a communication between the request of this python program and your Android application program , and must also be available 24/24
